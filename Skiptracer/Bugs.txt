Bugs
====

UI:
- Lots of autolayout warnings.

Alerts:
- Breaks started from a delayed user reaction to a note don't send break end notes at the correct time.  Reschedule them.
- Breaks started with a note, and then manually ended, will still send a break end notification.
- Cancel notifications for reports stopped on other devices. (How?  Use Remote notifications?)
