Plan
====

0.3 Alerts
----------

Scheduling:
* Schedule all 64 notifications whenever possible. (in handleNotification?)
* Reschedule notifications (when changing break/progress settings).
* Delete notifications (with activity/report delete, alerts on/off switch, other times?)
* Alert on/off switch (should change settings switch too)

0.X iCloud
----------

iCloud UI:
* Use iCloud switch (should change settings switch too)
* Always append (n) to names when creating, and editing, etc

Browser:
* Handle deleted objects by going back to root VC
- Handle merged objects by refetching, or something

Bugs:
- Handle NSMergeConflicts (especially common when changing Now picker) (use NSMergePolicy?)
- Sometimes new reports aren't imported. (seen many times) (only reports generated in NowVC UI?) (see AppData refreshProperties and refreshCurrentReportAndBreak?)
- Sometimes all reports disappear. (seen once)
- Solve fail on first launch after clean (non-production builds only?)

Testing:
- Test turning network on/off
- Test turning iCloud on/off

Other:
- Cancel notifications for reports stopped on other devices.  HOW!?!

0.X Workflow
------------

Workflow:
- Require/allow reports to be manually started?
- Join previously deactivated reports if a new one is started quickly?
- Add background breaks when app resumes? (keep a lastUpdate time)
- Prevent reports from being deleted when their activity is deleted.

Model:
- Separate break and progress settings into separate objects.
- Implement atomic activities

Now UI:
- Now UI for atomic activities (checkbox, ding?)
- Now UI for break countdown.
