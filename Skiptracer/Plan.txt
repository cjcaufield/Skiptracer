Plan
====

0.X Workflow
------------

Atomic:
* Implement atomic activities (don't set the active flag)

Relationships:
* Activity detail "move-to-parent". (Push a new Activity VC, but with a "selectionMode" property set)
* Report detail "select-activity". Activity switcher to use pushed VC, just like "move-to-parent"

Table:
- Move controls from Now view into footer.
- Double tap to start/stop.
- Make group rows push to a new Activity VC.
- Share footer between views.  HOW?
- Add UI for atomic activities (checkbox, ding?)

0.X iOS9
--------

- System notification confirmation appears every time.
- Alerts not appearing.

0.X UI Polish
-------------

- Now UI for break countdown.
- White on dark grey theme (like OSX notification center)
- Today widget?
- Device rotation?
- iPad SplitViewControllers?

0.X Graphs
----------

- Combo control for chart type.
- Pie chart for activities (all, or parent) for Day/Week/Month/Year/Life
- Bar chart for " (use tableview rows for bars?)
- Calendar chart (dots for day highlights only) (use tableview rows for weeks?)
- Color picker algorithm
- Color picker UI
- Chart configuration UI
- Link from Now (and Detail) views to relevant charts.

0.X iCloud
----------

iCloud UI:
- Use iCloud switch? (should change settings switch too)

Break/Progress:
- Separate break and progress settings into separate objects.
- Implement deduplication logic for separate break and progress settings.

Activities:
- Implement deduplication logic for sub-activities.
- Handle case where an activity moves to a new parent in merge/deduplication.
- Prevent reports from being deleted when their activity is deleted?

Browser:
- Handle deleted objects by going back to root VC
- Handle merged objects by refetching, or something

Bugs:
- Handle NSMergeConflicts (especially common when changing Now picker) (use NSMergePolicy?)
- Sometimes new reports aren't imported. (seen many times) (only reports generated in NowVC UI?) (see AppData refreshProperties and refreshCurrentReportAndBreak?)
- Sometimes all reports disappear. (seen once)
- Solve fail on first launch after clean (non-production builds only?)

Testing:
- Test turning network on/off
- Test turning iCloud on/off
