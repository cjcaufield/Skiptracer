Plan
====

0.3 Alerts
----------

Scheduling:
* Fix nextBreak/End/ProgressDate to always return future dates.
* Schedule maximum number of notifications up to a certain period in the future.

Lifespan:
* Reschedule notes (when changing break/progress settings).
* Delete notes (with report delete, ...)

Times:
* Handle 0s progress bug.
* Handle invalid break interval/length values.

0.X iCloud
----------

iCloud UI:
* Append (n) to names when creating, and editing, etc.
* Properly update VC cached objects (including NSFetchedResultsController.deleteCacheWithName)
* Handle dropped objects by going back to root VC.

Issues:
- Solve fail on first launch after clean (non-production builds only?)
- Solve sync error messages (not a problem?)
- Solve occasional sync failures between iPhone/iPad.
- Test turning network on/off
- Test turning iCloud on/off
- Cancel notifications for reports stopped on other devices.  HOW!?!

0.X Workflow
------------

Workflow:
- Require/allow reports to be manually started?
- Join previously deactivated reports if a new one is started quickly?
- Add background breaks when app resumes? (keep a lastUpdate time)

Model:
- Separate break and progress settings into separate objects.
- Implement atomic activities

Now UI:
- Now UI for atomic activities (checkbox, ding?)
- Now UI for break countdown.
