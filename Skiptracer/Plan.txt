Plan

0.X iCloud
----------

iCloud UI:
* Use iCloud switch (should change settings switch too)
* Always append (n) to names when creating, and editing, etc

Browser:
- Handle deleted objects by going back to root VC
- Handle merged objects by refetching, or something

Bugs:
- Handle NSMergeConflicts (especially common when changing Now picker) (use NSMergePolicy?)
- Sometimes new reports aren't imported. (seen many times) (only reports generated in NowVC UI?) (see AppData refreshProperties and refreshCurrentReportAndBreak?)
- Sometimes all reports disappear. (seen once)
- Solve fail on first launch after clean (non-production builds only?)

Testing:
- Test turning network on/off
- Test turning iCloud on/off

0.X Workflow
------------

Workflow:
- Require/allow reports to be manually started?
- Join previously deactivated reports if a new one is started quickly?
- Add background breaks when app resumes? (is this even possible?  keep a lastUpdate time?)
- Prevent reports from being deleted when their activity is deleted?
